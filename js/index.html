			<p>An interactive way (duh) to control your sphero through a browser.</p>

		<section id="howto">
			<p>You obviously need a Sphero. Once you have that, you can either control it with a Leap Motion, the arrow keys + space on your keyboard or, if you are a gamer with the more familiar WASD (+ Space) combo.</p>

					Arrow Keys: No surprises here, Up will move forward, Down backwards, Left and Right will move in these directions. Space will turn the Sphero clockwise by X degrees.
					WASD: Again, no surprises. W is forward, S is back, A and D are left and right respectively. Space will do the same as with the arrow keys.
					Leap Motion: Control your Sphero with swipe gestures. Good Luck with that! Gesture recognition really sucks at this point... It's fun though, just don't try this our near a pool or a crevice.
